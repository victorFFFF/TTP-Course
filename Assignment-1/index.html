        <p class="line">George Floyd was an African-American man who died on May 25, 2020, after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for at least seven minutes, 
            while he was handcuffed and lying facedown on the road. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng also helped restrain Floyd, while officer Tou Thao stood nearby and looked on. The incident occurred during an arrest of Floyd in Powderhorn, 
            a neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was recorded on cell phone video by several bystanders.The video recordings, showing Floyd repeatedly saying: "I can't breathe", were widely circulated on social media platforms and broadcast by the media.
            The four officers involved were fired the next day. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the incident, 
            at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department, while the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) is investigating whether there were possible violations of Minnesota statutes.
            Demonstrations and protests that began after the death of Floyd were initially peaceful, but windows were smashed at a police precinct, an AutoZone store and a Wendy's were set on fire, and stores were looted and damaged in the surrounding areas, including a Target and Dollar Tree.
             Law enforcement responded by shooting tear gas and firing rubber bullets into the crowds. Floyd's death has been compared to the 2014 death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who repeated "I can't breathe" while being suffocated by arresting officers. </p>
